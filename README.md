# Hands-on Workshop: Modernize Web Forms apps using DotVVM

This sample app was adapted from the ["Getting Started with ASP.NET 4.5 Web Forms and Visual Studio 2013 - Wingtip Toys" tutorial](https://i1.code.msdn.s-msft.com/Getting-Started-with-221c01f5/view/Discussions#content) for Visual Studio and ASP.NET Web Forms 4.5.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to install [DotVVM](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm) into a non-trivial ASP.NET Web Forms app and how to integrate with Forms Authentication.
